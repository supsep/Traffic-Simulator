Traffic Simulator

By  : Sep Taheri

Assembly

Description :: Using an ARM Eduational board provided by the University of Victoria, 
I developed a Traffic Light simulator that compares to the real world.

The board included buttons, multiple screens for walking indicator, traffic lights,
pedestrians, cars and a buzzer.

Re-wrote in C and Assembly.
